## **Robinhood**

*What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?*

Robinhood is an internet stock trading platform that offers unlimited commission free trading for 
* Stocks in the U.S. public companies
* ETFs
* Stock options, and
* Cryptocurrencies

Robinhood's competitiors include Coinbase, E-trade, and others


*How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?*

RobinHood customers primarily access the RobinHood trading platform via an easy-to-use mobile app, in
contrast to the PC focus of most of the more established players, such as Schwab or E*Trade. This, of
course, appeals to RobinHood’s target market, i.e. Millennials, a demographic segment that has been
under-served by established banks and brokerage firms. Another Millennial-friendly difference between
RobinHood and the others is that RobinHood accounts have no minimum deposit.

*Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?*

RobinHood’s fee structure (or, rather, no-fee structure) illustrates the dramatic cost savings that efficient
internet processing can provide. It also demonstrates how such processing can disrupt the
commission-based business model of other, more established on-line brokerages, such as Fidelity or
Charles Schwab. And on-line stock trading is an enormous business, serving as one of the two killer apps
that powered the growth of the internet in the 1990’s (the other was internet pornography).


*What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?*
